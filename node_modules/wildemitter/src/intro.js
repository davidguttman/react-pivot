/*
WildEmitter.js is a slim little event emitter by @henrikjoreteg largely based
on @visionmedia's Emitter from UI Kit.

Why? I wanted it standalone.

I also wanted support for wildcard emitters like this:

emitter.on('*', function (eventName, other, event, payloads) {

});

emitter.on('somenamespace*', function (eventName, payloads) {

});

Please note that callbacks triggered by wildcard registered events also get
the event name as the first argument.
